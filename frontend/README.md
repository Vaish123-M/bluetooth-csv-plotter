# üì° Bluetooth CSV Plotter Web App

A modern full-stack web application built for the **Thryv Mobility internship assignment**. This project demonstrates Bluetooth communication with a mobile device and interactive CSV data visualization‚Äîall within a clean, responsive React interface backed by a Flask server.

## ‚úÖ Core Features

### üîπ Core Task 1: Bluetooth Communication

- Scan and list available Bluetooth devices from the frontend GUI.
- Allow the user to select a phone from the list.
- Establish a Bluetooth connection to the selected phone (assuming it is already paired).
- Implement two-way communication:
  - Send a string message from the system to the phone.
  - Receive an acknowledgment message from the phone and display it in the frontend.

> ‚úÖ Tested using **nRF Connect** (BLE peripheral app) with UART service enabled.

### üîπ Core Task 2: CSV Upload and Plotting

- Upload a CSV file manually from the local file manager.
- Backend parses the CSV using **Pandas**.
- Frontend renders an interactive line/time series plot using **Plotly.js**:
  - Zoom and pan functionality.
  - Toggle visibility of individual columns.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Bonus Task (Partially Attempted)

While the frontend and backend are ready to handle CSV transfer over Bluetooth, **sending a full CSV file from nRF Connect was not feasible** due to app limitations. As a result:

- CSV transfer from phone to system was not fully implemented.
- The rest of the pipeline (receiving, storing, and plotting) is functional and ready.
